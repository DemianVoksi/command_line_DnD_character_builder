Command Line D&D Character Builder

This Command Line D&D character builder is a beginner Python project
which will help you to build a Dungeons & Dragons 5e character.

Current scope of character building:

1) You are able to build a level 1 character. I am working on
implementing the ability to build higher level characters and
the builder will be updated soon.

2) Races, classes, subclasses, spells and all equipment are
currently restricted to those available in the 5e Player's Handbook.
I plan to include additional options from official
D&D materials as soon as I can.

To start the character build process, run __main__.py
which is located in /dndcharacterbuilder/scripts/
